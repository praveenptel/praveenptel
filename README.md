## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Staff-level Backend Engineer** with a strong track record of:

- Designing and scaling **business-critical backend systems**
- Taking products and platforms from **early design (0)** to **high-scale adoption (1M+ usage/events/users)**
- Operating at the intersection of **architecture, execution, and leadership**

I work closely with:
- Senior engineers, tech leads, Architect & CTO
- Product managers & stakeholders
- Platform, infra, and DevOps teams

My focus is **long-term system health**, not just short-term delivery.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Designing **scalable backend platforms** handling high throughput & burst traffic
- Improving **system reliability, performance, and cost efficiency**
- Leading architectural decisions across multiple services
- Mentoring engineers on **system design & backend craftsmanship**

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Advanced **distributed systems patterns**
- JVM performance tuning at scale
- Cloud-native architectures (K8s, EKS deep dive)
- How to grow impact as a **Staff / Principal-level engineer**

---

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Backend-heavy, system design–driven projects
- Open-source tools related to:
  - Distributed systems
  - Observability
  - Performance optimization
- Knowledge-sharing initiatives (design docs, architecture reviews)

---

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Real-world scaling challenges (10x–100x growth)
- Staff+ engineering best practices across orgs
- Open-source collaboration opportunities

## 🏗️ What I Do as a Product Engineer

### 🔹 Architecture & System Design
- Design **fault-tolerant, scalable microservices**
- Make trade-offs between **consistency, availability & performance**
- Review and approve **org-wide design proposals**
- Own technical direction for critical systems

### 🔹 Execution at Scale
- Build systems handling **high RPS, large datasets, and async workloads**
- Drive **performance optimization & cost control**
- Ensure clean APIs, backward compatibility & safe migrations

### 🔹 Technical Leadership
- Mentor senior & mid-level engineers
- Raise engineering standards via:
  - Code reviews
  - Design reviews
  - Best practices & guidelines
- Act as a **multiplier**, not a single contributor

---

## 🧑‍💼 Impact Highlights

- Led backend systems from **initial design → production → large-scale usage**
- Designed platforms processing **millions of events / requests**
- Reduced system latency & failure rates through architectural improvements
- Owned multiple services end-to-end: **design, build, scale, operate**
- Worked across regions (India / EU) with distributed teams
